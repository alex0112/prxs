# Usage

`prxs` is keyboard-oriented, with a lower input field for complex operations and simple keybindings for more simple things

## Keybindings
- `m` to return to the main tab
- `p` to copy a request to a new tab
- `(a|s|w)` to select the pane with that symbol in the left-hand corner
- `(i|:)` to start typing in the input field
- `j` or the down arrow to scroll down
- `k` or the up arrow to go up
- `f` to forward the currently-selected request if it has not been forwarded or dropped yet
- `d` to drop the currently-selected request if it has not been forwarded or dropped yet
- `q` or escape to quit
- `e` when a tab's notes pane is selected to open the notes in an external editor

## Input
- `:{integer}` to go to the tab with the specified index
- `:gz` to try gunzipping the currently-selected request's response (or the response on the currently-selected tab)
- `:q` to quit
- `:rn {name}` to rename the current tab (if it is not main) to the specified name

## Config
The default config file is located at the equivalent of `~/.config/prxs/config.toml` (different for Windows and macOS).

The command line flags can be generated by running `prxs --help`:

```
Usage: prxs [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -c, --config <CONFIG_PATH>       The config file to parse
  -p, --port <PORT>                The port to run on
  -s, --session [<SESSION_FILE>]   The session file to open
      --auto-gunzip <AUTO_GUNZIP>  Whether to automatically gunzip request responses [possible values: true, false]
  -h, --help                       Print help
  -V, --version                    Print version
```

All of these options, besides `help`, `version`, and `config`, can be overridden in the config file.
